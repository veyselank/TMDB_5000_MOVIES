# TMDB_5000_MOVIES[TMDB 5000 MOVIES Revenue Prediction Project]
Introduction
We are living in a time where movies are seemingly more popular and attractive than written sources such as books, which makes movies much more profitable than any other media source. This project includes the collection of TMDB 5000 Movies and their relationships. My aim is to determine different conclusions on frequencies and features of movies. We have a dataset that is collected from a long span of dates but there are a few movies entered into data compared to recent data. So we may need to clear this accordingly in order to deduce the spread (resulted in more skewed data). Afterward, the dataset needs to be examined and mined by the group members regarding its budget, ratings, popularity, genres, title, cast, and crew(by the features of the dataset). Lastly, the project will be finished with a discussion of the descriptive results and possible future works about the ML model.

Problem Definition
In order to achieve the goal of this project, our main goal is to predict the revenues according to the other features of the dataset (country, language, budget, popularity, votes, etc.). In our data, the goal is planning to use some of the statistical methods like z-score testing, hypothesis testing and pearson correlation tests to figure out and choose the features and eliminate the unrelated ones, signifying different relationships and finding out relevance and dependence between the features and samples. In order to achieve the goal of this project, members will use feature engineering and statistical methods to detect these kinds of relationships. After cleaning, and selecting the right type and amount of features, we will start designing our model. While designing our model, we will re-check the previously calculated selections and do further changes depending on the results of our model. In the end, our purpose is to create the best model, that has low bias and low variance between the data, and has the least error score. Also we will try our model to be applicable to new data.
